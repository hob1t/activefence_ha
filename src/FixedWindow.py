    The time is divided into windows of fixed length, and each request inside
    a window increases a counter.

    Once the counter reaches the maximum allowed number, all further requests
    are rejected.

    Pros:
    - old ones do not starve Newer requests.
    - Low storage cost.

    Cons:
    - A burst of requests near the boundary of a window can result in twice the
      rate of requests being processed because two windows will be filled with
      requests quickly.
